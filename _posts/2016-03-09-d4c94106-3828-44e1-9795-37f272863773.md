Vilnius is a great comfy place even it was raining almost all time. Little city with a beautiful cozy "Old Town". A lot of places to drink coffee or eat something. We found a great restraint where I had a great risotto with seafood. And prices are not hostile.

Not sure if I'd like to live in a such place, but I'm glad to have an opportunity to visit it sometimes.
