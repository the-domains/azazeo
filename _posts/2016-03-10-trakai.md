Trakai - little town in a 15 miles away from Vilnius. Small, cozy.  Beautiful village houses and ugly soviet buildings are standing around main street. It's some kind of (semi)island the town stands on.

There is a castle in this town. Castle stands on little island and a long wooden bridge provides the way to it. It's not a tourist season so castle and museum are closed on Mondays (there was a Monday when I was there). Anyway that town left a nice impression.
