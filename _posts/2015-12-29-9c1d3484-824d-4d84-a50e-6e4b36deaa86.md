Smartphone cameras are great. They are great because they are always near and ready to shot. And sharing are so easy with all communication capabilities of modern phones.

But mobile cameras has downside because of they physical size. Fixed angle (usually wide) is not perfect for portrait shots and there is no way to zoom in something without quality penalty.

But some kind of macro and still-life photos can be done great with mobile phones. And panoramas.
