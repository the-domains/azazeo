Smartphone cameras are great. They are great because they are always near and ready to shot. And sharing are so easy with all communication capabilities of modern phones.

But mobile cameras has downside because of they physical size. Fixed wide angle is not perfect for portrait shots and there is no way to zoom in something without quality penalty.
